        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Cooking has been interesting to me since I was young. There are so many varieties,flavours, condiments and combinations it looks like there is no limit to what you can make.<br> <br> There have been some favorites amongst my family when it comes to food like pizza,pasta,burgers all homemade from the pizza dough,to the pasta sauce. We do try and make some variations but these are our specialities. On a relaxing Sunday afternoon, the process begins. We start by rolling the dough a couple of times through the pasta machine so that it becomes very thin,but not so thin that it can come off easily. Then we cut the dough into many squares and fill a pumpkin and spinnich filling in the middle, folding it carefully, making sure the dough doesn't tear. After that we brush it in oil so that it is slippery and does not get stuck to the pan and then take it for cooking in a pan brushed with oil too. For flavor you may add olive oil or parmesean cheese if you want...</p>

They are so attractive and you can read them for a long period of time. The 7 book series is also on Prime Video,Hotstar, etc. and you can never get board of reading /watching it. The age of the series is 8-13 years but even my parents and grandparents saw it with me !!

        <h1>Favourite food-"Spagetti bolognese"</h1>
    <br> <br>
            Whenever I used to go out, it was mostly italian restaaurants that we went to, but when the lockdown happened, my mom and family were very dissapointed so they found a way to make it for me at home.The one my family made was even better than the restauraants so now it has become like a ritual because we make it every one or two weeks and it becomes better the more we make it.

        Since I was 4 1/2 years old, I was introduced to the sport of Tennis. I still have been playing it till date and I practise a lot of it. At 9 years, basketball also was an opportunity as when I was watching my brother play it passionately, I thought,"I might actually be good at this !"
        In August,2019 I was one of the three children part of the inter-school basketball tournament. But things were'nt all smooth still. we had to take 1 hour practise everyday, either after school on weekdays, or in the morning on weekends. after many tough and tiring matches, we ended up in 2nd place, hoping to take the gold trophy  next time.
